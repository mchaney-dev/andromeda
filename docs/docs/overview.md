# Overview

Andromeda is a Python package for generating text using cutting-edge natural language processing models. It is meant to be simple, able to be used by anybody at any experience level. The main goals of the project are to:

-   Serve as an easy-to-understand introduction to text generation, even for those with little to no programming experience
-   Investigate the efficacy and practicality of using an NLP model for assistance with creative writing
-   The package should be modular and expandable; contributions are always encouraged

It is built using [HappyTransformer](https://www.happytransformer.com) and [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index) under the hood.
